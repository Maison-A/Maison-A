# Howdy, I'm Maison! A Software Developer

## About Me
Hey everyone - My name is Maison and I develop software! 

I was an Infantryman (11B) with the US Army with the 173 IBCT(A), 2/503 "THE ROCK". In my time with the 173 I spent a majority of it in eastern Europe and Italy: jumping, training, eating and traveling.

When I got out of uniform, I went to school after spending some time transitioning to civilian life. I attended and graduated from Cincinnati State with an AS in Computer Programming & Database Design and have been off to the races ever since!

### My Philosophy & Work Style
My philosophy when it comes to programming & software development is "principles first".

I can learn any tech stack because I focus on understanding the underlying principles & patterns that are common across all stacks.

I don't get emotionally tied to my code - it's a tool that needs to get a job done, nothing more, nothing less (not so much the case for my personal projects üíö).

#### I'm currently working on personal projects and keeping an eye out for opportunity
