<h1>Howdy, I'm Maison! A Software Developer</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I was an Infantryman (11B) with the US Army and picked up my first gaming PC while in uniform (this matters I promise). While learning how to game on PC (I'm console native), I found that I was fascinated with how the machine worked. 
So, naturally, I started coursework for software development while I was still active.<br>
When I got out of uniform, I went to school after spending some time transitioning to the civilian life.
I attended and graduated from Cincinnati State with an AS in Computer Programming & Database Design and have been off to the races ever since! 
</p>
<p>Tldr; I'm an Aspiring Renaissance Man </p>
