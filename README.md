# Howdy, I'm Maison! A Software Developer

## About Me
Hey everyone - My name is Maison and I develop software! 

I was an Infantryman (11B) with the US Army with the 173 IBCT(A), 2/503 "THE ROCK". In my time with the 173 I spent a majority of it in eastern Europe and Italy: jumping, training, eating and traveling. I found there to be enough down time on rotations to justify picking up a new hobby - I went with my first gaming PC. Was an Alienware or something - but that's now what's important. What's important is the fact that it threw my into a new world that would eventually lead me into the open arms of software.

While learning how to game on PC (I'm console native), I found that I was fascinated with how the machine worked. I tinkered, googled and investigated enough to find myself signing up for courses - while still active!
When I got out of uniform, I went to school after spending some time transitioning to civilian life. I attended and graduated from Cincinnati State with an AS in Computer Programming & Database Design and have been off to the races ever since!

### My Philosophy & Work Style
My philosophy when it comes to programming & software development is "principles first".

I can learn any tech stack because I focus on understanding the underlying principles & patterns that are common across all stacks.

I don't get emotionally tied to my code either - it's a tool that needs to get a job done, nothing more, nothing less (not so much the case for my personal projects üíö).

I work fine in teams or solo-dolo. I do not mind either situation as long as work is getting done!

#### I'm currently working on personal projects and keeping an eye out for opportunity

## **Tldr; I am an aspiring Renaissance Man that will make any tech stack sing**
